I am a Data Scientist (+ Data Engineer) in TeleWare Plc. My interest includes NLP, Machine Learning, AI and the automation process behind them.

## AIM & Motivation ##

The Aim of this repo is to help myself re-study LaTex with my currently using Editor Sublime Text 3, increase my productivity with coding & writing.

This repo is inspired by Christopher Manning and the blog (How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTex and Vim)[https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/]

## Why LaTex & Why Sublime ##

About LaTex: I am not new to LaTex. I use LaTex to generate the math-related content (sometimes full paper) in my writing since 2013. But I did not systematically studied LaTex although elegant LaTex always attracted me. The blog I mentioned above encouraged me to fully go through LaTex and make it a truely reliable tool in my skillset. 

About Sublime Text 3: Sublime Text got me when I first meet with Python + Editor combination. Not saying other Editors are bad, since I am also a fan of Atom and VS Code. But I stays with Sublime when it comes with production. It is also a good time to re-study Sublime as well to help me work better.

## Schedule ##

No timetable (cause I am lazy, bit me), but in the initial stage, I will follow the 

- [short course from MIT](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/new-LaTex.pdf)
- [LaTex Tutorials from Indian Tex Users Group](https://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/tutorials/ltxprimer-1.0.pdf) 

to fully understand LaTex system.

Some other book recommandation from [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/26645810/answer/33515971).
